make html that will take user input and show gift certificate in real time preview so as user enters and selects drop down gift certificate changes in real time.

once all fields are entered and user clicks on add to cart. you can save that in db.

1. The app. should be a MVC-like with simple dummy MVC classes. Eg. a View class will look like:

class View
{
	protected templateFilename;
	public function __construct($templateFilename)
	{
		$this->templateFilename=$templateFilename;
	}
	public function show()
	{
		include($this->templateFilename);
	}
}
2. No controllers. The script/page itself will act as a controller method.
3. Need 2 client side classes: Form and GiftCertificate.
4. Server side: MVC dummy classes, and a GiftCerticateRecord for storing the data.
